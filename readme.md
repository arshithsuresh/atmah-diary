# Atmah Diary

_Where your soul speaks back._

Ever thought about writing something down and reliving the moment again into the future?  
A place where one could see the mistakes and the emotions he had when writing down a piece of heartfelt note?  
A transparent way to share your feelings right from you heart and let the reader know all that was going through your heart? A place where we could be vulnerable comfortably.

This is the feeling I got when trying out the project from [`Diary by Madhaven`](https://github.com/madhaven/Diary).
